Earthquake Escape

Overview

Earthquake Escape is a text-based slide game built in Twine, utilizing HTML and CSS for customization. In this game, you must navigate through a building during an earthquake, making critical decisions to escape safely within a time limit.

Gameplay

The game features 30 different situations/locations within the building.

You have 15 minutes to escape.

Each movement to a new situation costs 1 minute, so you must plan your path carefully.

The goal is to find a safe exit before time runs out.

Installation & Setup

Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

No additional software is required.

How to Play

Read each scenario carefully.

Choose between multiple options to proceed.

Each choice will lead to a different outcome and may impact your chances of escape.

Keep track of your time! If you run out of time before escaping, the game ends.

Customization

Open the .html file in a text editor (VS Code, Notepad++, etc.).

Locate the <style> section to edit CSS for styling.

Tips for Success
